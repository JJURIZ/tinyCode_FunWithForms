# tinyCode_FunWithForms
Project using Express.js - Learning about HTML Forms. Take 2.

Project origin was simply to learn more about HTML Forms.
This soon turned into a full Express.js app, using MDN's fantastic Express Tutorial.
Rather than copy/paste or type in their example, I chose to modify it by creating a dental intake form.

Prior to creating the environment I created a basic HTML intake form. 
I wanted to learn how to translate the form into data saved to a database, not simply to the filesystem.
I came across the MDN Express.js tutorial and chose mongoDB Atlas.

Choosing not to follow the examples precisely resulted in many, many challenges.
One of the first was populating my database using the prescribed tool. I was able to modify the populatedb file to create insurance, employer, and patient records. 
Even when this was done I had to figure out how to associate insurance companies and employers with patients, which I did.

Each step was a challenge. What I took away from the first week of the project was a deeper understanding of the MVC model. I had only a tenuous grasp on it before. 
After a few days when I needed to figure out why a page was generating an error I was able to track it back to the proper file and fix the problem.
